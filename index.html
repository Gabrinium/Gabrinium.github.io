    <p>
        Hello! i am Gab, the person behind Gabrinium!
    </p>

    <p>
        i am a very ambitious person with a goal
    </p>
    
    <p>
        to create a lovely community filled with people
    </p>

    <p>
        that you can connect and feel comfortable with!
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are some fun facts about me:
    </p>

    <p>
        I love Programming, Animating, 3D Designing,
        <br>
        Streaming, Hanging out, Maybe singing.. LOL
        <br>
        and i also love creating things when im in a productive mood!
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white;">
         To be completely clear and honest with you all, Gabrinium is a company
        i've been wanting to create for about 5 years now, and i've finally
        worked up the courage to finally try and make it happen!

        that does not mean that i'm in here for the money. my main and true goal
        is to build a positive, chill, and helpful community where i can be myself
        and hang out with people that are like-minded! while at the same time,
        growing Gabrinium into a company that creates technology-based products
        tailored for people like me and you that loves technology that are useful
        and of high quality! I love you all! Take care!!
