                Hello! i am Gab, the person behind Gabrinium!

i am a very ambitious person with a goal

to create a lovely community filled with people

that you can connect and feel comfortable with!

Here are some fun facts about me:

I love Programming, Animating, 3D Designing,
Streaming, Hanging out, Maybe singing.. LOL
and i also love creating things when im in a productive mood!

            </p>

            <p class="abtmf">

                To be completely clear and honest with you all, Gabrinium is a company i've been wanting to create for about 5 years now, and i've finally worked up the courage to finally try and make it happen! that does not mean that i'm in here for the money. my main and true goal is to build a positive, chill, and helpful community where i can be myself and hang out with people that are like-minded! while at the same time, growing Gabrinium into a company that creates technology-based products tailored for people like me and you that loves technology that are useful and of high quality! I love you all! Take care!!
